        What is a ‘novel’ coronavirus?
        A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus.
        <br>
        <li>The disease caused by the novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) – ‘CO’ stands for corona, ‘VI’ for virus, and ‘D’ for disease.
        Formerly, this disease was referred to as ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ or ‘2019-nCoV.’
        <br>
        <li>The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.
        <br>
        <li>How does the COVID-19 virus spread?
        The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing), and touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple disinfectants can kill it.
        <br>
        <li>What are the symptoms of coronavirus?
        Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia or breathing difficulties. More rarely, the disease can be fatal.
        <br>
        <li>These symptoms are similar to the flu (influenza) or the common cold, which are a lot more common than COVID-19. This is why testing is required to confirm if someone has COVID-19. It’s important to remember that key prevention measures are the same – frequent hand washing, and respiratory hygiene (cover your cough or sneeze with a flexed elbow or tissue, then throw away the tissue into a closed bin).
        <br><li>
        <li>How can I avoid the risk of infection?
        Here are four precautions you and your family can take to avoid infection:
